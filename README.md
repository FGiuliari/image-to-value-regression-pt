# Image to Value Regressor using Deep Learning

## Download datasets

### Depth
[FATDATA]() - TBD

[SYNTH_GENDER]() - Synthetic dataset generated with [MakeHuman](http://www.makehuman.org/) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). The regression value is the _gender_ factor of MakeHuman (between 0.0 and 1.0). All the images are aligned, cropped in 4 different ways: full-body, head-less, head-leg-less, head-leg-arm-less. Each graylevel represents 3 mm of depth precision.

### RGB
[WIKI_CROP_ALIGNED]() - WIKI dataset from [IMDB-WIKI](https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/rrothe/imdb-wiki/) face dataset aligned with [Face Frontalization](https://github.com/dougsouza/face-frontalization). All the images are cropped to the size of the face-mask.
